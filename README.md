## About 1889 Development

1889 Development provides professional IT consulting and systems engineering services for startups and growing businesses in the Norfolk, VA area.

### Our Philosophy

The year 1889 marks a turning point in human progress—when craftsmanship evolved into engineering, and isolated tools became interconnected systems. We build infrastructure the same way great engineers built railways and power grids—**intentionally, structurally, and with longevity in mind.**

Not quick hacks. Not disposable tools. **Real systems that endure.**
